	<p> Study Spot (studyspot-ucsb.herokuapp.com) was my project for HackSB Winter 2015. I found myself with the problem of not wanting to trek all the way to the library to find a quiet place to study, and if I did I would just end up not being able to find a seat or an outlet. Study Spot solves that problem by taking in a time and day of the week and displaying all of the empty rooms on campus.</p>

	<p>Here is an example of the list of buildings that have available rooms. I used a python script to scrape the html of a public list of class schedules in order to generate the data used for the site.</p>

	<p>After selecting a building in your vicinity, you are shown a list of available rooms. I included how long the class is available and the class size. That way you don't end up finding a class just to be kicked out 20 minutes later by an incoming class, and you also get some insight on to what kind of class it is.</p>
