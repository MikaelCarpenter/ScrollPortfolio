	<p>Skive is a Tournament Hosting Framework that allows twitch.tv streamers to generate income doing what they already love to do. Skive currently targets video game streamers, but will expand in order to automate all gaming tournaments, no matter the audience.</p>

	<img src="assets/images/work/Skive/skive-create.png">
	<p>Streamers are able to use our tournament "forge" to generate their custom tournament for free(hosts don't pay buy-in). The payments work like Kickstarter. When someone wants to join a tournament, they 'pledge' the buy-in amount, but the money isn't actually taken until all the slots are filled and the tournament begins. </p>

	<p>Once the host has selected all of their settings, we use an algorithm to generate their custom brackets. The brackets update live in the browser, with no need to refresh the page.</p>
