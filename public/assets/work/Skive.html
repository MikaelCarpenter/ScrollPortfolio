	<p>Skive is a Tournament Hosting Framework that allows users to make money and play competitively anytime with anyone. Skive currently targets twitch.tv streamers, allowing them to generate income doing what they already love to do. We plan on expanding in order to automate all gaming tournaments, no matter the audience.</p>

	<p>Users are able to use our tournament "forge" to generate their custom tournament. They can choose their game as well as control various tournament settings including buyins and prizes.</p>

	<p>Once the host has selected all of their settings, we use an algorithm to generate their custom brackets. The brackets update live in the browser, with no need to refresh the page. Once someone registers for the tournament the buyin is deducted from their account and prizes are distributed automagically when the tournament ends. We also included a board to display rules and notes as well as a chat box so that participants can communicate with each other.</p>

	<p>Also, once the tournament has been created, a 'card' is displayed on our home page with the tournaments info, so that people can find and join public tournaments. Skive is still in beta, and we plan on implementing much more in the near future.</p>
