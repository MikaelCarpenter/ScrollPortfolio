	<p> This past summer I was a Front-End Intern for Guidebook. I had a great summer with Guidebook and they were able to help me learn so much! I started the summer working on the new <a href='https://builder.guidebook.com'>'Builder'</a> which is where clients go to build and manage their guides. The front end team uses React, Flux, and Backbone, so I was able to get hands on experience with these libraries. This builder is a massive project and during my stay I was able to touch and contribute to a large portion of the project. </p>

	<p>The Builder itself consists of customizable widgets that you can add to your guide. This is a look into the Schedule widget, which can contain a list of Sessions that people attending your event might want information on.</p>

	<p>When you want to add a new session you are presented with a form to fill out that will create your session. Actually one of the tasks I had was to create custom<a href='https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react'> Formsy </a>rules that help check the validity of the form a user tries to submit. There's a lot in this app so it's hard to show off all of the things I was able to work on, but my main work this past summer was actually on a brand new project for Guidebook.</p>

	<p>I was given the task of trying to build a mobile version of Builder using React-Native. The purpose of the project was to see if the web version of Builder could be translated to mobile as well as have a new product that can be used by clients who need to update their guides straight from their phone. After six weeks of work, I was able to complete the Native-Builder, and I learned so much along the way! This project ended up allowing me to really delve deep into the React community where I was able to learn a lot, as well as help others. I even ended up publishing my own node module because of this project. It's an easy to use navigation bar for React-Native apps called <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/gb-native-router'>gb-native-router</a>. All in all, my summer with Guidebook was incredible! I learned way more than I could have ever imagined, because the team there was so supportive and helpful. It was a truly invaluable experience.</p>
